# Under Construction #

**J-game** is a game about moving to Japan and studying at a language school.

It is a visual novel/simulator written in [Ren'Py](https://renpy.org/).

        Each week you set your study time-table, avoid burn-out from over study, and focus on finding a balance to learning enough to pass each term exam and attempt the JLPT🧑‍🎓.

        Plans are to have secondary goals:
        * 🏃running a marathon, or
        * 🎒visiting all 47 Todofuken in a year.
